data = data for computing prototypes + test data

r_project = R project files to prepare data for prototype extraction and test; Scripts to reproduce results of the paper

results = models' results including cosine similarities

saved_babyberta_models = BabyBERTa models downloaded from https://github.com/phueb/BabyBERTa

vectors = models' sense prototypes
