2	that's the letter and this is the envelope
1	what letter is zi zi zi zi zi
13	when we go for walks in the afternoon mummy nearly always finds a letter to post so that you can post it
10	that probably means the postman is on his way delivering letters
1	two letters this morning
5	the postman has delivered two letters
13	and if you wanna post something then i'm sure mummy has got a letter to post
2	for weighing letters to see how much it costs to post them
8	oh the postman has come back with another letter
3	oh another two letters three letters
5	and he takes all the letters away to a sorting office
18	and then when the post people know where they're going to another postman comes along with all the letters in his big sack
8	and he goes round all the houses pushing letters through the letterboxes
5	we've just been talking about letters
4	which begins with that letter
16	daddy wrote to paddington bear and paddington bear wrote back and daddy has still got the letter
10	is it a big red box where we post the letters
4	we write cards and letters and put them in envelopes
18	and the postman comes along in his van and he empties the box and he collects all the letters in his sack
10	the postman come to the door earlier on with some letters
2	these are letters are the alphabet thomas
3	you recognize the letters don't you
2	they're like letters of the alphabet aren't they
4	you've just posted the letter through your post box
4	we've been posting some letters
5	thomas is obsessed with posting letters
9	and i held you up and you posted four letters
11	we come here to our front door and we post some letters through the door
2	pick the letters up off the mat
17	and he comes along with his key and he opens the door and he takes all his letters out and puts them in his bag
3	here's some more letters to post
10	and he opens the door and he tips all the letters into a big sack
3	are you posting letters
3	are you posting letters
4	he must be posting letters somewhere else
29	i think you're probably talking about our front door because the other day when we went for a walk you insisted when we came back that we posted some letters through our front door
10	and then when we opened the door picked up the letters from the doormat and then doormat and then you made me shut it again so you could post them back again and we did that over and over again
11	we banged the door shut and then you could post the letters again through the yellow box
9	i think the big bang is when we're posting letters because you open the door and then shut it loudly don't you
6	so you can post some more letters
1	two letters through the box
15	do you want me to set up your post box so you can post the letters in here
3	you were posting letters through the door weren't you
8	and then i'll go and get you some letters to post
7	that's your postman sack with all your letters inside
6	oh is that for daddy that letter
7	are you going to post some more letters
4	there's a lot more letters on the rocking chair to post in the post box
3	like you posted letters through the yellow boxes in the post box
2	but they're letters are put into envelopes and it's the envelopes we post
10	somebody must have posted something to us other than a letter because the postman has already been
11	like we have a slot in the letterbox when you post letters
23	you played in the wendy house this morning and you kept closing the door and opening the door but you didn't post any letters through the letterbox did you
4	we couldn't find the letters
12	would you like mummy to go and get the box and the letters
3	empty all the letters into a sack
2	you post letters through letterboxes
3	when you post letters in the letterbox you can't put your hand back in and get them back can you
4	did you hear the letters going through the box
3	he's just delivering letters to auntie linda
2	he brought letters to our house didn't he
9	i didn't hear alice barking though when he delivered letters next door
1	it's letters
5	has he brought us some letters
2	there's a letter for mummy
4	oh and that's a letter for mummy
7	and mummy thought it was a nice letter
5	he didn't have any more letters for us had he
14	well he has been already because when mummy came downstairs daddy had already a letter that wasn't here last night
4	when daddy writes a letter i go and get my pen and write a letter too
4	thomas you can't post letters out through the box
4	when we wanna post letters we take them we don't post them through the door here do we
6	you wanna you wanna post some letters
9	i would imagine the postman's still wandering around delivering letters
7	you're saying b because you're thinking of letters of the alphabet
8	she looks like she's going to post some letters
1	post letters
5	well if mummy leaves some letters would you go out with grandma and grandad to the post box to post them please
0	letters with stamps
13	you go out for a walk with grandma and grandad and post some letters for mummy
5	he was already delivering his letters then
4	but there weren't any letters so you posted some plates and a mobile phone
4	did christopher post some letters
21	yes you need those shoes on because listen thomas soon we've got to go to the post box and post a letter to margaret
5	we put some put a letter through her letter box didn't we
2	that's the letter a
2	and more letters that make a word underneath
6	and another word made up of letters in white writing
3	we've got two letters to post haven't we
8	and everybody was going to her door with letters and parcels
2	well the letters are over here and you're strapped into your chair now
1	two letters
5	your postbox with all the letters
4	you dropping all the letters into the box
7	that's not a that's not a nice letter through the post is it
6	and we're going to post some letters
3	he was emptying letters into his sack and a lady who just missed he post collection wanted to send a letter
3	we've got two letters to post haven't we
9	now i don't think we'll be taking these uh letters thomas
4	because these are the letters that you play with in your post box
1	the letters mummy's taking are ones that she has written this afternoon
14	and grandad and you went to sleep and grandma came downstairs and wrote a letter to some friends in germany
1	two letters
5	he picks up all the letters in his sack
4	there'll be knock ring letters to your door
4	he reaches for the letters in his sack
3	you're picking up letters now are you
0	letters in his sack
2	when the letters came through the door i heard you say something
14	he didn't wave this morning but when there was a big bang when the letter fell through the letterbox you said something about the postman
1	some letters to push through peoples doors
6	because we get a lot of letters and a lot of cards
5	and he got all the letters in his sack
6	he just comes to deliver a letter
1	a letter for you
0	letters through your door
3	was this the letter that postman pat took to auntie mabel
4	what happened to the letters
3	it wasn't just letters
7	and pat has obviously collected all the letters from the postbox outside the post office
2	they're wooden letters of the alphabet aren't they
13	on one side they have a picture of something that begins with that letter
4	carrot begins with a letter c
6	do you think our postman delivers letters to the teletubbies
6	i bet postman pat delivers their letters
5	oh now we've got another letter coming out of the box
2	it's a letter for thomas
6	it talks about a postman delivering letters
3	this is xxx letter
12	on the morning of teddy's birthday the postman brought him a special letter
2	a christmas letter
2	a christmas letter
3	where's the christmas letter
1	christmas letter
3	it's a christmas letter
3	now this is letter i
7	that's very clever knowing that's a christmas letter
2	well they're letters
1	they're letters of the alphabet
1	these letters as well through the post weren't they
5	i can count how many letters there are
4	there are twenty six letters in the alphabet thomas
9	and when you get halfway though you get to letter m
0	letter m
1	thirteenth letter of the alphabet
8	and for every page it takes so many letters of the alphabet
6	show pippo the monkey on the letter m
2	these are letters of the alphabet
2	what other letters do we know
2	what other letters
2	we have letters that postman pat brings don't we
3	but they're not letters of the alphabet
13	so every page has a picture with something on it starting with that letter
1	they're letters and cards and parcels
9	like the first one has an elephant under a letter e and the last one has a zebra under the letter z
1	the letter n is painted yellow
13	well i think the orange snake is a caterpillar because it begins with letter c and that's on this page
2	oh another letter of the alphabet now
3	and the next letter is q for queen
3	we've got the letter w on this page but they're saying w is for wheel
5	you've actually pointed to the letter a and said apple and there isn't a picture of an apple there is there
8	and yellow is what they've chosen for the letter y
5	that's like when we're posting letters
2	some more letters
3	we've got more letters of the alphabet here haven't we
2	no more letters to go through the post box
1	more letters here
1	more letters through there
4	that might be some letters going airmail
2	because the letters that you're posting will probably end up going in a post van
6	or some of them xxx posting letters xxx
9	but if we were writing to auntie ruth the letter would go in an aeroplane like we did to spain
1	the letter would go in a bag and go all the way to spain in an aeroplane and be delivered to ruth in spain
6	are you busy stacking all the letters up
4	so were are these letters going
4	you're stacking xxx the letters back in the box as if you're stacking shelves in a shop
8	they're on a plane so they're air airmail letters are they
9	i don't think the pilot will insist that the letters wear a strap though do you
10	the postman didn't shut his doors and some of the letters have fallen out
1	two letters there
3	and there's another letter
12	there are some people here on the floor who might like some letters thomas
9	tinky winky sitting here with rabbit waiting for a letter
8	noo noo's saying i wonder if there're any letters for me today in thomas's post box
17	it's a good job she has got a scooter and she can ride home because now the letters are very heavy to carry aren't they

4	have you got more letters to deliver thomas
6	some more people here waiting for letters
16	all the ones that belong to the teletubbies needta go in this box and all the letters that belong to winnie the pooh needta go in this post box

8	i thought you said somebody sent you a letter
6	right so you imagine all the letters in a line thomas
6	so if you imagine all the letters in a line
1	what letter would it begin with
7	you imagine walking into a line of letters
6	so you remember a line of letters and the very first thing you step over the a and the next thing you bump into that barrier

6	and then it says find the letters that spell out the illustrated word
2	insert the letters in place on the s on the card
9	so what you hafta do now is find the letters that spell out these words

19	but yes the ones you've found so far the s and o are exactly the same whether they're big letters or little
4	and what's the last letter of soap
2	and what letter is that thomas

11	and it's it's almost like doing a puzzle slotting the correct letters into the the stencil
7	and when i go to post the letters you can come with me
