This folder contains the training and test data used in the simulations.

ChiSense-12_for_nlm = data taken from ChiSense-12 dataset (Cabiddu et al., 2022), which includes 9 target words.

ChiSense-12_for_nlm_extended = data which adds 4 new target words to ChiSense-12

sense.tsv = mapping of word senses to target words. This file is a copy of senses_ChiSense_extended.tsv; If you want to run simulation on ChiSense-12_for_nlm, please first delete sense.tsv, then create a copy of senses_ChiSense.tsv and rename the copy as sense.tsv
