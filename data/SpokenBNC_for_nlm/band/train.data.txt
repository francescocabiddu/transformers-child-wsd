23	he sat on this mower you see and and er as it cut the sheafed it off you see and we'd to make bands y you know with pieces of s er and then the lifters put that on the bands and bound them and through the the site

4	i mean sometimes a band can be so bad but they're really interesting cos they're so bad
9	i think that's that's pretty consistent probably with how bands are formed actually isn't it its friends of friends and somebody knows somebody else and somebody's looking round for a drummer just happens that somebody mentions it to somebody else
17	then they continue they hand you the tape you ask them a few questions like what the band's called how long you've been working together and bla bla bla and then erm i think i i'm actually doing it with kent and james and they're not thick
