64	right well we have two hundred and sixty five pounds and sixty eight pence in the bank at the moment erm which actually isn't very much if you think that we've got to go right through to july to our next fund raising event so i was wondering that if anyone hasn't paid their subscriptions for last year or if anyone owes for christmas cards i think there's one or two
5	but there's still some christmas cards
9	i think the interesting thing is is the five card erm is is the brag you play or the poker you play and how much to raise the ante
3	a pack of cards
3	you draw four cards out one after the other
14	if you get four aces out we make sure it's a fresh deck of cards and everything else and nothing's fixed
2	if those cards that you get are four aces i'll give you a thousand
7	i remember sitting helping to write the cards the night before and we were writing them off a typewritten sheet
11	erm out of er the five hundred and forty two er cards went out
11	now we're a bit off christmas we've we have had christmas cards from norway indonesia mauritius northern island not to mention the er scotland and england
6	oh me and my boyfriend play cards and watch telly and that sort of thing
7	well that's where we used to play cards on top of the dustbin
23	and this man he was a regular dustbin dustbin man and he'd been at it all his life and he used to play cards with us and his family his sons and and as many else as got any money to play pontoon or brag
9	and it would always come when we were playing cards
16	or or anything you know so this er man one day he says we were playing cards he said i'm bloody fed up with this
8	well in hospital i mean the number of cards and get well cards and well good wishes i received and offers of help from people
15	and everybody that sent cards i mean it was really great i mean get well cards are sort of things that you see in shops and you never really think about it but when when you're lying flat on your back in hospital and you get cards for people i mean it really does give you a lift
50	but i mean it's it er it was great i mean the fact that i was i mean in in aberdeen i was away from home i mean you didn't even notice it because of the number of orcadians that popped in by the hospital and as i said sent cards and letters it was great
34	i want you to send them in to me and here's where er it becomes a little bit different from other competitions i want you to send them in to me on a christmas card please
13	we want to get really festive about this so answers on a christmas card only please to the following address
8	answers the five of them on a christmas card to and your cards to be in please by first post next friday the seventeenth
4	answers on a christmas card to and the christmas cards please with your answers to be in by first post next friday the seventeenth
26	we've actually had a recycling paper project going on over the last couple of months which made paper out of shredded newsprint and then made christmas cards out of them
23	so it's it's small things like that which although on their own as we didn't recycle but for all those people who bought cards and the people they send them to are are now aware that they need to create a market
8	but you'll you'll if you're only doing the card you'll do that much quicker
17	we'll find while he's just finding that look there's just one more item that's erm a christmas card from so i'll pass that round so you can have a while we're just trying to find
5	and obviously if you playing cards close to your chest you need something like this to sort of be able you know
14	i can tell you this the general public have sent me literally hundreds of cards i have had well wishing cards i've also had some letters from the opposition some of them to be quite honest have been disgraceful
18	the the guys went up there and they fixed it and they were very very we had christmas cards from them and we've
22	we decided to use our green ballot box that we made and painted for the maastricht campaign for people to post their cards into so that we can count them at the end and post them all together
18	now i think erm ron was a bit upset because he spent most of of christmas sending christmas cards and saying please please let this bill go through don't give it any
20	it could have it like those like those like those or like those so that would be one deck of cards that you'd be given and they'd have the four types of symbols on them separately of course
5	now the alternative deck of cards in b would be those four
15	your task is regardless of the symbol that appears on the left to sort the cards into the four shapes right
13	okay the task was to ignore the right hand bracket and to sort cards based on the left hand bracket in fact you'd sort them into two piles not four
12	the way it was done was that if you imagine putting one card in for psychology two cards in for research methods one card in for psychoanalytical approaches three cards in for memory and so on and so forth an then they were sort of drawn out and then when a topic had been picked the other cards were removed
10	cos it looked just like er well on a christmas card you know with the straw down
4	but instead of playing cards and talking and making their own enjoyment probably
4	and they'd be written cards put put out to everybody
34	where they come into their own is let's say that you wanted to phone me in july because my wedding anniversary is in july you could turn to the back of the july calendar card write down call ricky elliot on the seventh because it's his wedding anniversary erm and write down my my telephone number and then distressing though i find this idea you could forget the whole thing confident in the knowledge that the system will remind you
16	for any sort of forward prospecting or monitoring that you do the backs of the calendar cards are absolutely invaluable
8	so on the back of the may calendar card i wrote down his name and telephone number and put n e c in brackets
17	the the back of the calendar card the notes that make on the back of the calendar card will be in sequential order presumably
39	what you do on that first page of the month is you put those that that page that says to be done in january ninety four or whatever erm you put the notes on the back of the calendar card in priority order and add any other formal targets you've got
8	i mean there's lots of sets of playing cards alright you've just got to do an action
15	well how is she supposed to find out from you what her job is tarot cards reading the leaves in your empty tea cups extra-sensory perception
16	and i it's better than them round there they even sent one another a frigging christmas card
