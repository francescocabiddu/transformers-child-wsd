19	oh i'm sorry appear but er i'd have thought this tree's g er g erm willow trees make cricket bats and cricket bat manufacturers will purchase willow trees
15	mm mm i heard an interesting programme on radio shropshire which talked about the tailed bat which brought out the historical importance of the building and i learnt one or two things that i didn't know apparently one of the very early carvings who plays sidney i think and yet yet it wasn't er destroyed until the next revolution took place
40	in the latest incidents an antiques dealer was attacked at keele services on the m six shortly after midnight and yesterday a woman driving along a quite country road in chepstow had her car rammed by a gang wielding baseball bats
4	took off like a bat out of heaven
17	if you kind of drop down behind the blue if you use the blue first and the bat's up there you got ta go sort of near to it to get behind you're going to rush down to your hoop
5	oh it looks like a bat
10	that's like the one we saw on the telly a bat
13	oh there's one right in front of us look blind as a bloody bat gill
7	he's probably having a visit run like bat out of hell good gracious
4	he's blind as a bat
2	get this bat thing get a smash his head open
4	he's got a baseball bat
3	he got baseball bat as well
5	what'll they do with baseball bat
12	oh they loved that yes and er that one's played with a bat to off and there's no run
21	lawrence in again bowls ooh and has a bit of trouble with this one gets it on the bottom of the bat from which it bobbles away it's a short leg and there's no run
40	one hundred and eighteen for three which means thirty-nine runs added in the first hour today and it's tufnell coming up now to bowl dasilva up he comes bowls this one dasilva pushes forward and it just goes under the bat and fielded there by the wicketkeeper no run
8	yes while attempting to hit him with a bat
38	faster than the other one hits him on the pad or bit of that pad maybe robin smith's very close in there and once or twice he's dived he's never quite sure whether off the pad or off bat and pad everybody shouts at him poor chap anyhow catch it a hundred and eighteen for three end of that one from tufnell so he's now bowled fifteen overs two for seventeen that one was yet another maiden
58	what what it's frustrating for a slow bowler is that if the batsman put his left pad down the wicket and held his bat up in the air clearly not playing his shot for all to see then i'm sure that we you know it the batsman be given out l b w quite frequently but because the bat is hovering just behind that left pad erm he's never given out
5	wonder why he took his bat up just away i don't know
8	he give it a full swing of the bat
21	he's had a good game they've both had good games difficult for them with the ball turning and fielders round the bat
21	away he goes lawrence again to the right-handed and that's short on the back foot plays it down with a dead bat ball bounces little more than a yard or two
8	best bite of erm when everybody's round the bat and there's a bit of action
11	they'll they'll be happy with this situation with fielders around the bat and having to make decisions
34	there's robin smith who's moved a little straighter in fact you can't call him silly point now he's more of a silly mid-off on that's sort of line and he's about three yards on bat two men out deep on the leg side there's tough on the who's hoisted that one away on the leg side i think that could well be safe for who's chasing wicket two bounce it's over
20	away goes lawrence shirt soaked with sweat he bowls to who plays well forward taking the bottom hand off the bat and the ball rolls up to lawrence who doesn't field it it's hugh morris running from short leg who then hands the ball to philip defreitas gives it a good shine on his right thigh
14	away goes lawrence to takes it again with the bottom hand away from the bat it's off the back foot this time stabbing it down in front of him a short of a length ball
4	he's just hiding the bat behind the pad
17	mates of theirs if there's a fight they come back with blades and that and like baseball bats hammers they get ready for a fight but they're all gone
3	don't break the bat just smash
4	see you smashed that bat against the wall
3	don't throw his bat
2	see that bat's useless for long rallies
4	hey don't use my bat
5	cos i don't like your bat alex
26	but erm the next one went can i have an ice-cream please and the the man hit him over the with the head with a baseball bat and he died
3	erm we had bats down there but i haven't but not the last two two or three years i don't know where they've gone
20	and under the deepened dusk he felt the thoughts and desires of the race to which he belonged flitting like bats across the dark country bogs
25	youngsters like keith piper have blossomed and though neither are playing today alan donald and tom moody have made a major impression and impact with bat and ball
19	so we're going to come back to that at several different points during the day or two and lastly bat and ball
21	and what we've now done is put together a similar type of interview but which is as we said yesterday a bat and ball situation where i ask a question he answers it leaving the next question hanging if you like
6	the fans are equipped with baseball bats and knives the club's symbol a pelican has a bomb attached to its foot and this presumably rival supporter has had his eye gouged out
