26	i've got a number down here er seventy percent of total costs of egg production are var are variable costs and essentially that's the feed the chicken feed
8	and gathering chickweed out of the neep the chickens and that for green feed when they needed and they were confined in a small small space where there was no green grass to feed them on

6	after christ after christmas pudding and chicken thank you
6	i think it's worth having a chicken for the soup do you
18	so he said well they have a grill at the top he says so if you're cooking a chicken instead of it coming out pale th the grill will come on and it will brown it
37	a cold starter and a hot starter but there's a buffet that's about half the size of our club and one side of it it's all fish on a wet fish slab and steak and veal and chicken and so there's every sort of meat you can think of and you can pick a wooden platter full of it so you go and give it the chef with this number that they give you and then they
21	i think she sort of she she she didn't say she said she's not allowed er she's not allowed to have chicken and cucumber
6	yeah but she karen won't eat chicken
0	chicken and fish
4	no meat at all chicken and er fish
8	you can't you can't see no blood in chicken you can't see no blood in fish
2	all my chickens got killed
1	your chickens
3	you know the chickens we had don't you
6	that's the ones that killed the chickens
1	our chicken got killed
8	you look out one window you see a chicken look out another window you see pigs
11	whether there still is i mean i used to hear the chicken making a ruddy noise
8	they're their their animals that's all like that chicken up the garden i mean i don't know what it's in might be in a run but being the place that is in behind that shed there ain't that much space with a rabbit as well is there you know i mean there might be a run on the floor it'll be crazy to have a run on the floor because she's had rats
34	and she's had rats under that shed it ain't that long ago she said she said she had them so i mean i can't see anybody with an ounce of common sense letting a chicken being on the ground ground
5	it's a bit of a chicken and egg thing really
6	yeah like the electricity but your chickens come home to roost when your overtime goes when your job goes and you take on a commitment and they never the last ten fifteen twenty twenty five years and they've never ever ever taken on a commitment like that before when it's presented with just the roses around it everything's sweetness and light and roses and the other side isn't really put put to you think of the worse
22	because they must know what's gon na happen when they you know when the cows come home they must know when the chickens come home to roost they must know what's gon na happen
8	he goes well i was playing with your chicken like this and it spat at me so i bit its head off clamped its eggs and set fire to its nest
7	a chick a chick a chick a chicken
39	i remember visiting a year or two ago a project in mexico where an american organization had moved in and made a careful study decided that the ideal thing for the local people to do would be to raise chickens so they put fences up supplied them with goodness knows how many hundred thousand chickens within a year they'd killed the chickens pulled the fences down and used them to cook the chickens and they were back exactly where they
13	i think it's very hard to separate the two but it's a big chicken and egg to say which came first the social conditions or the furnishings is erm is very hard to say but they are i mean like in that example that i just gave they're very strongly tied up
