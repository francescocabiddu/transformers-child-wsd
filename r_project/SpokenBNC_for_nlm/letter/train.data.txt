36	if you apply to the fund at the beginning of the month you'll likely to get something but hard luck if you apply later on in the month but that she's taken up as an open letter to jerry hayes but so far i haven't seen it in the press

2	writing a letter to chris patten about the protocol
1	a letter which says they they have stopped doing it
5	and a and a short letter i do don't know whether you said that
2	they wrote letters and they did didn't have the energy
8	no val have we still not had a letter from er
4	we we had a letter from the international secretarium in august or september i think saying that they'd changed the law and all prisoners of a certain category should have been released and our prisoners were amongst our prisoner was amongst that list but erm they didn't say that they haven't got any definite news whether he had been or not about the release
31	yes and on the whole recently we've had prisoners who been imprison for sort of two or three years we've we've made up petitions we've sent postcards and we've we've written letters and er they've been released in reasonably short space of time but then mostly the prisoners which who haven't had a very long sentence unlike the one i mentioned on the way here tonight have the russian who had been in
38	mean i i was very much got the impression from her i i'm sorry i didn't get a name the chap i was speaking to but erm it he he was very distinct that we should get a letter from i s and that have conformation and and er and send it on you know that they all should also should get a copy so it it strikes me we should perhaps write a write to i s and
41	'll certainly do some letters and if anybody else wants to if they let me know i'll let them have the addresses for them erm there are fax as well and that suppose to be a quicker way than writing a letter actually than send through a fax right erm if anybody can then we could send them to you and and ask you to send it on and we would sort of postage would be covered would it margaret
3	er the news letters we get monthly news letter for groups er this one which is all about what different groups in britain are doing can give you ideas
5	i'll erm the international news letter which has lots of groups and details about people getting killed
63	hospital without access to medical treatment for something like ten days and erm saria did say she'd help me last time and i wrote back and said yes two of us could write once a month well they're taken that very liberally and and got two or three things from the already and erm if anyone else is interested in writing an odd letter say once a month to yugoslavia maybe they could erm let me know later on
30	we held it after prep so we've organised another one for tomorrow lunch time and erm and lot more people express interest because of that we haven't actually got any letters yet
16	cos you see perhaps it didn't get to that teacher you see that's what happens the letters don't always get to the right people
5	erm i also have a letter er from a kate i'm not sure from which school she goes to but she's fourteen and she's going to one of the local schools
33	so imagine you were writing jayne here j now it's a very long name jayne and you have to put the title on there too so i couldn't put it all in capital letters on this occasion could i
7	well but they did say in their letter
4	yes yes get a letter out and come back to me
47	please continue to send papers for any relevant meetings and an attempt will be made to respond to appropriate issues if there is any specific topic you wish to be considered please do not hesitate to get in touch so i thought that was quite a nice letter seeing as i practically read them all
16	handwriting i could make my handwriting neater larger i could try joining my handwriting have the letters joined some people are still more comfortable printing in year seven
34	i'm going to bring in some illuminated medieval books for you to have a look at because what you're going to do is to write this out in best on special paper using illuminated letters and if you're very good we will try to get them laminated so that we can keep them as an example of what year seven students can produce as their best work to say to everybody hey look at this this is very
40	i also say that the erm the fear expressed about woolwich i believe to be fairly well founded woolwich building a woolwich er building society had been on erm entered into a long time ago on this erm and the letter that was read out at potter street area committee from woolwich indicated that they hadn't yet decided whether they would proceed and er i think is i've talked to the publican since they have promised us an answer
39	out and what i can say to you at this stage is that we have another meeting scheduled for next week we will be meeting with the resident's associations keeping them fully informed erm we will ensure that the letter goes back to mrs who and the other resident's associations who expressed concern there and that we will be taking i hope i hope because i'm gon na have to say if woolwich back out we're going
15	yes but on the last comment that er chris made er bringing us and the letter to county about the the failure of the meeting on the twenty second cos we feel that they are just lying down to the situation and not pursuing a pursuing the d a p about whatsoever and erm we are certainly in john's letter probably get it signed tonight complaining and asking for a a meeting as soon as possible because we feel that
9	i understand it's the only way in which these letters are arranged in the anglosaxon language and is often used as an example of such
2	the fancy letters the m and the t really need a powerful pack like coreldraw
4	usually mean the last letter cos most of the elem well a lot of the le the elements have one letter
10	two goes down there so it's two what two whatever letter came before it
2	each capital letter starts a new element and that would mean one c a one o and two hs but what i is one c a and two o hs which is two
4	what's what's the last letter
5	t punct and then u letter u and then ation a t i o n
1	capital letter
1	capital letter for the first one full stop at the end that's the main point
6	when else would you need capital letters
6	okay so the important things capital letters and full stops you already know how to use them
2	a capital letter
14	erm one problem i think is that you can you tend to look at letters i think sort of one or two letters together erm instead of trying to think of a whole word
15	because i when you do think about the word then you leave some of the letters out
5	okay so good a capital letter on there yeah
1	capital letter full stop
1	capital letter erm
7	well have a go at the first letter
5	erm if they've got a letter e in the s for the s for the next letter then usually they'll have a k
9	very good the only the only there's only one letter wrong in that have a guess which one it was
15	if you're just trying to remember them all and you've got all these words and letters floating round in your head it's quite awkward isn't it trying to sort them out which is which cos there are you know millions of words
24	yeah if keep keep it sort o erm alphabetically okay so you've got the as then the bs the the cs depending on which letter the word starts with
3	well the other letters that are not vowels all the rest of them are called consonants
51	and even you'll probably get one or two of them wrong occasionally but most of them'll be right and when you get one or two of them wrong the teacher'll say oh not c k like desk for example not c k on the end of desk because it's got this letter s in it as well
15	i would think your ks are probably pretty good if you can do a good letter f
5	okay which are the hardest letter for you to do
9	right so when you do when you do the letter i try to keep it we'll do a letter i here
5	but if you're doing the letter e it goes up there and comes down okay
14	yeah picture them in your mind and then just draw them just write the letter d dog door
32	the only excuse me er no we even had abbot a double b er didn't always get in front but i think it should have done you know you take the first letter and then you take the
6	and each one had got different letters of the alphabet ion it and that's how we learnt the alphabet
17	it's easier it's the easiest thing is when there isn't a number in sight when it's all letters
21	right normally write it a if we get an a a b a we'd write it a b we keep the letters in alphabetical order when we multiply just so we can see what's going on
32	it's it's it's e once once you get over this shock of aargh i haven't got a number oh what am i going to do nothing to cling on to it's all letters ooh i can't do it i can't do it
3	because algebra is letters and if you have got er something which is you need a root of it or you can do it with a number you can't do it with a letter
