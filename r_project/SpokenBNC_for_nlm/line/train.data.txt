13	she stood on a chair and i used to have to draw the lines round the back of her legs with a pencil
2	a white line about half a centimetre from the edge of the work being put on
5	right this is a decorative line round the sides of
3	just a white line
13	now you can make that look even smarter by making a second white line on the outside
14	and then moving the erm ruler slightly away from the border for the second line over the top of it which makes it thicker
6	so you've got a thin white line on the inside and a thicker white line on the outside
7	and i'm going to put a guide line which is one erm er half a centimetre from the side there
6	i've put two very faint white lines there in white
20	now there are still traces of ink on the surface but now you can much more clearly see the etch lines because they're full of now
16	and i tend to draw most o most of us tend to draw them as straight lines with branches coming off they may actually show the chain as a twisted chain or zig-zag chain or going in to form a square or something
9	well i mo moved because promotion was in the line for me i was in the royal marine police in island depot in plymouth and er i'd been put on plain clothes work and i'd been doing acting sergeant you know when the sergeant was off sick and all that business and er i'd put been put in for this to move because we had a two bedroom bungalow but the twins were getting big and i realized
22	i think it's significant that on page one eight six of our of the blue book we report four sentenc for er lines from the top two presbyteries expressed a desire for the whole practice of infant baptism to be re-examined only two presbyteries
16	moderator the counter motion is in section four as it stands to stop in the second line after the word commentary
4	there we read in line seven of the desirability of retaining a bilateral contact between our two churches on matters of doctrine a desire express i'm glad to note by our roman catholic friends and that's good
5	then in the last two lines of the appendix i read the panel on doctrine seeks permission for the joint commission to meet twice yearly as necessary to study documents of doctrinal interest
19	and if you wan na look at this graph the period we're talking about is indicated with these dotted lines and you can see the green line here representing u k residents holidaying abroad
22	we need you in a semicircle and the best way to do that is to push your chairs roughly around that grey line
16	well here here are char for example this is a female you see the the white line on the fins and the very pale pink spots this will actually get gradually more highly coloured until about december when they will be quite bright red and and in my opinion not a question really but might be that some of these other ones are pretty nice as well here's quite a quite a dark little trout probably been in the light
6	shift f nine selects the current line we've not er stated i think
8	yeah shift f nine er accepts the current line where the cursor is is located
15	your text and your paragraphs are indented by one tab stop but accept the first line
8	because you can go down in your first line move to the first letter o after the number hit the tab key and you've actually lined up the first line along with the rest of your paragraph
12	and that's the medical word for it draw write it in a line
16	if you think about it you slide it into where the joint would be along the line of the femur bone you bend the knee up and you pull it right up and you rotate it
8	what does erm that blue writing the third line down
5	if there was a long line of people number of seven for the seven dwarfs and they were all standing there side by side and they had their hands over there face like so and the altogether at the same time in unison they parted the hand to reveal the facial expression that is more of a dramatic experience to people looking than just by standing here
9	completely overtaking against th o over the double white line in all that traffic
35	so we're parking illegally but the police actually have almo they've said they will turn a blind eye to it if providing that we all do it sensibly and without and face like in the line of the traffic
10	this question of er lawfully cross or straddle double solid lines
7	you can overtake on a double white line
11	what it says is you must not cross or straddle the line
14	cos when they place these they're always in a zone of danger double white lines
15	you either stamp lucas up his right buttock or you go over the double white lines or you brake and somebody behind might be too close behind you
6	it's not bounded by a solid line but it's just a normal hatching
6	it's like er a double white line with broken lines on your side
6	but as far as a solid line is concerned don't do it because i it immediately if you if you o do transgress it'll mean penalty points if you're seen doing it regardless of the consequences of it
13	if you'd like to just pass those along to the end of the line then we'll collect them all up
4	the end of the line
3	in a long line horizontally you'd think oh i'd like to put these vertically
10	oh just before the finish fifty metres from the finishing line
9	and then janet overtook her just before the finishing line
4	you just draw a line of best fit you know line of best fit through erm all the points well
12	and there's one stray off here you'd go through that way the line of best fit
6	how about the gradient of the line
4	the gradient of a line okay there's a there's a bit of graph paper
5	better get rid of that line yeah
8	that's from t so i dr drew a line a cir a circumference
17	draw round it dot dot dot draw even if you then sketch it without using a straight line if you just join up the dots freehand
6	complete that table plot a straight line graph and use your graph to find these values
12	then we'll get those two points and that'll give us our straight line
14	if we join we've got three points now once we know it's a straight line three points is enough
24	two is enough really but just to be on the safe side use three and if they don't all lie in the same straight line then one of them's wrong
9	okay now check they all lie on a straight line
3	let's draw the line in first
12	so the points seem okay what's wrong they're not in a straight line
9	okay and they should all be in a straight line
2	draw a line of vowels and see if i mate a make a word or something
13	sixty of them and put them out and make them into nice little lines and that and see what things you'd have to multiply together to make twelve or what numbers you'd multiply together cos it'd be so many sets of like four sets of three or three sets of four
30	okay so you decided on your scale and you decided it was nine centimetres along there okay and f the way to do it fairly accurately is just draw a line that's a bit longer than nine
15	in the county council's opinion the northern boundary of the site which comprises variously a line of trees hedge and track effectively acts as a screen between the site and the open agricultural land to the north and can adequately prevent any sprawl of the village or encroachment onto the open agricultural land and will not therefore prejudice the special character of york
25	the question surely is whether land is open country not whether that open country is bisected by a boundary a good hedge or a good line of trees which would undoubtedly be a suitable greenbelt boundary
17	the district council also considers that the northern western western boundaries of the sites which comprise a line of trees hedge and track are appropriate well-defined and defensible greenbelt boundaries which separate the site from the open countryside beyond it
6	we had to stand in a line
12	i've been to newark on a friday night and stood in a line with others on a night shift at a w wooden hut in the yard whilst a clerk from the pay office came to meet us the day shift finishing at er say five o'clock
6	right then let's get in a line again
2	in a line again
17	these have got the time signature in but you're they're asking you to put in the bar lines and then grouping the notes properly
7	and that's grouping notes plus the bar lines
6	and then er there's a long line of changing jobs and eventually i came to dudley
12	you may have then had a verbal exchange with your next in line but bar that you were expected to get on with the work
14	well erm erm had a word with erm who was about oh fourth in line in the erm education hierarchy in those days and erm then spoke to who was the chief education officer and er i think they were a bit erm bit apprehensive about employing a blind typist because erm it was something that they had never had any experience of but in the end they thought it was worth a try and er especially after supporting me at
18	you're right at the head of the pecking order when the cash generation starts you'll be first in line
6	it doesn't have to stand in line behind anything else
4	with nottinghamshire first in line
4	edward was next in line but he abdicated for mrs simpson so george
7	well i think we are next in line to get some new ones
5	he's only only third in line i mean you can't just because he's
36	but no she's gone for this promotion in work and er even though she doesn't think she's much chance of getting it because there's two permanent lads there that really you know would be next in line rather than her sort of thing but she's you know she feels she's done her bit and that you know it's worth going for and like i said to her you might as well
7	well oh because i was standing in line
